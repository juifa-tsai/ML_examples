# Neural Network and Deeplearning (Michael Nielsen)
The more advance and popular machine learning method is Neural Network and Deeplearning reacenly, although the idea of algorithm has been discussed decades. Since the improved technology in the hardware, the computing resouce has been changed and more powerful. Some complex and non-linear algorithms can be achieved. We will follow an [online-book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com), written by *Michael Nielsen*, to give the exersice examples.

The programing language focus on **Python** and **numpy**. The performance and visualization for analysis are using **matplotlib** and **jupyter notebook** in **ipython**. They demonstrates the process of machine learning from data.

## [Exersice 1 - DNN](Chapter_01)
Introduce the **Dence Nearual Network (DNN)** algorithm with **MINIST** data for recognizing hand-written numbers. The programing language is using Python with **Numpy** package.
