# Exersice 1 - Introduction of Dense Neural Network
Introduce the **Dence Nearual Network (DNN)** algorithm with **[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)** data for recognizing hand-written numbers. The programing language is using Python with **Numpy** package. This exersice is correspoding to [Chapter 1](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) and [Chapter 2](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) of the book.

1. [Example 1 - First Training of MNIST](Example_01_FirstMNIST.ipynb)
   - Give the complete derivation equations of **backpropagation** basing on the books.
   - First import, visualize and train MNIST data.
   - **Active function** : *sigmoid function*, detial see [Logistic regression](../../Machine_Learning_in_Python_SR/Chapter_03/example_02_LogisticRegression.ipynb) as well.
   - **Cost function**   : *mean squared error*.
