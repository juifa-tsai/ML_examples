# Machine Learning and Nueral Network Exersices
The artificial intellegent (AI) has been a popular searching keyword in any field, e.g. marketing, robotics, art, biologics, physics anaylsis etc.. However, the **machine learning (ML)** is actually a fundametal branch and element behine the AI, and the **Nueral Network** or **(Deeplearning)** is also a revival and popular learning method in recent. To get into these technologies, we can not easily skip the fundametal knowledges of it. Thanks to many great experts from any corner of world and internet, we are lucky to have many good tools and books to learn and step into this field in elegant way. Also here we follow two major books, [**Machine Learning in Python**, *Sebastian Raschka*](https://sebastianraschka.com/books.html) and [**Neural Network And Deeplearning**, *Michael Nielsen*](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com), to demonstrate the **Machine learning**, **Nueral Network** and **Deeplearning** in two workbook projects, [Machine_Learning_in_Python_SR](Machine_Learning_in_Python_SR) and [Neural_Network_And_Deeplearning_MN](Neural_Network_And_Deeplearning_MN), respectively.

## Reference resources
All the technologies and theories inspiring and leading the following two workbooks are from several online metirials, courses and books, which I have learned since June of 2017. They have been well collected and recored in [resources.md](resources.md). For a beginner, they can help you to know the insight of machine learning systematically, rather than only learning the coding techniques or the tool usages. I beilive *"technology comes, technology go, but insight is forever"*.

## Workbook projects
### [**1. Machine learning in Python**, *Sebastian Raschka*](Machine_Learning_in_Python_SR)
The programing language focus on **Python**, and the packages of machine learning models are using **scikit-learn**, **pandas** and **numpy**. The performance and visualization for analysis are using **matplotlib** and **jupyter notebook** in **ipython**. They demonstrates the processes of analysis from data. Sometimes **Scipy** are used.

All the main contants and knowledges are refered to the book [**Machine Learning in Python**, *Sebastian Raschka*](https://sebastianraschka.com/books.html). Several detial theories and mathematical methods are inspired by the book [**Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning**, *Christopher M. Bishop* ](https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning.html?id=kTNoQgAACAAJ&source=kp_cover&redir_esc=y), and online course [**Machine Learning Foundations/Techniques**, *Hsuan-Tien Lin*](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/).
