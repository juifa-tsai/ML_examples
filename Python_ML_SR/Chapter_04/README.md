# Chapter 4 : Build a good training data : pre-processing
This chapter gives the basic examples for pre-processing data. Several tools can help us to make the dataframe processable and easier to be trained, e.g. **scikit-learn**, **Pandas** and **Numpy**. On the other hand, we also introduce the ***Regularization*** in machine learning. Two Regularization methods, **L1** and **L2**, have clear comparison in this chapter.
