# Machine Learning in Python Practice 
Follow the book written by Sebastian Raschka. The programing languge focus on Python, and the tool of machine learning is `Scikit-learn`. The another tool called `jupyter` is used for demonstrating the process of machine learning from data. Following has some scripts and documentation are helpful during programing.
* [command.md](command.md) : shows the common and useful command lines.
* [py2ipy.py](py2ipy.py) : convert .py to .ipynb.

## [Chapter 2](Chapter_02) 
1. Hand-made perceptron by `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib`
   * [Perceptron.py](Chapter_02/Perceptron.py) : class `Perceptron` for perceptron algorithm.
   * [runPerceptron.ipynb](Chapter_02/runPerceptron.ipynb) : Apply `Perceptron` to data, [iris.data](iris.data) , to demonstrate the learing process.
