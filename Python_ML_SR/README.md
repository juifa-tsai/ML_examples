# Machine Learning in Python Practice 
Follow the book written by Sebastian Raschka. The programing languge focus on Python, and the tool of machine learning is `Scikit-learn`. The another tool called `jupyter` is used for demonstrating the process of machine learning from data. Following has some scripts and documentation are helpful during programing.
* command.md : shows the common and useful command lines.
* py2ipy.py : convert .py to .ipynb.

1. Hand-made perceptron by `numpy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib`
   * Perceptron.py : class `Perceptron` for perceptron algorithm.
   * runPerceptron.ipynb : Apply `Perceptron` to data, iris.data , to demonstrate the learing process.
