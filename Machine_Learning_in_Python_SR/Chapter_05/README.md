# Chapter 5 : Feature extraction and reduction
This chapter gives the examples for feature extrcation and reduction which are very important topic in data analysis, especially in model training. Here we will introduce some common method, e.g. **Principle Component Algorithm** **(PCA)**, **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** and **Kernal PCA**. I also introduce the fundamental theories about **Kernal algorithm**. The exersice data is using wine data and demonstrating with pure **Numpy** packages, and than comparing with using **Scikit-learn**.

1. [example_01_PCA](example_01_PCA.ipynb)
   - The theories of PCA.
   - Exersice with pure **Numpy** and **Scikit-learn**.
2. [example_02_LDA](example_02_LDA.ipynb)
   - The theories of LDA
   - Exersice with pure **Numpy** and **Scikit-learn**.
   - Comparison with PCA
3. [example_03_KernalPCA](example_03_KernalPCA.ipynb)
