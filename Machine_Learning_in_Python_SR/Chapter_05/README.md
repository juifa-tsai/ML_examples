# Chapter 5 : Feature extraction and reduction
This chapter gives the examples for feature extrcation and reduction which are very important topic in data analysis, especially in model training. Here we will introduce some common method, e.g. **Principle Component Algorithm** **(PCA)**, **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**. The exersice data is using wine data.

1. [example_01_PCA](example_01_PCA.ipynb)
   - The theory of PCA.
   - Exersice with **numpy** and **scikit-learn**.
2. [example_02_LDA](example_02_LDA.ipynb)
   - The theory of LDA
   - Exersice with **numpy** and **scikit-learn**.
