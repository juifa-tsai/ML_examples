# Chapter 6 : Model validation and superparamers optimation
Model validation and superparameters optimation are strongly correlatied the results of the learning. The validation can check and avoid the **underfitting** or **overfitting** problem during fitting before applying model to test or comming new data. The optimazation of superparameters can fine tune the model to fit better with the helps of validation. The method introduces here includes example of ***Pipline***, **K-fold cross-validation** and **nested cross-validation** etc....     

1. [example_01_validations](example_01_validations.ipynb)
   - Using **pipline** to simplify the process of fitting
   - Achive the **k-fold cross-validation** by **scikit-learn**'s packages.
   - Visualization of learning curve for checking overfitting problem.
